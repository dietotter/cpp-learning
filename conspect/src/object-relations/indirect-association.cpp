// In this particular example, doing things this way is kind of silly,
// since getting the Car out of the CarLot requires an inefficient lookup
// (a pointer connecting the two is much faster). However,
// there are advantages to referencing things by a unique ID instead of a pointer.
// For example, you can reference things that are not currently in memory
// (maybe theyâ€™re in a file, or in a database, and can be loaded on demand).
// Also, pointers can take 4 or 8 bytes -- if space is
// at a premium and the number of unique objects is fairly low,
// referencing them by an 8-bit or 16-bit integer can save lots of memory.
