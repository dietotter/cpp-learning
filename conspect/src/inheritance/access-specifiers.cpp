// D3 can access its own members without restriction. D3 can access D2’s m_public2 and m_protected2 members, but not m_private2.
// Because D3 inherited D2 publicly, m_public2 and m_protected2 keep their access specifiers when accessed through D3.
// D3 has no access to Base’s m_private, which was already private in Base.
// Nor does it have access to Base’s m_protected or m_public, both of which became private when D2 inherited them.
